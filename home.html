            <h1>home</h1>
            <p>this is a home where love does not live<br>
            where it does not grow or flourish<br>
            but is earned<br>
            where it is given and taken away and not shared<br>
            this is a home where pride and reward live in love's place<br>
            under blue-white light<br>
            faux daylight for night work and not conversation<br>
            where blinds are turned closed tight for invisibility<br>
            sunlight squeezes its way through in dribbles not floods<br>
            into warehouse rooms of tools and instruments<br>
            with too few chairs for christmas dinner<br>
            this is a home where love is performed<br>
            quite well too<br>
            so at a glance you cannot see through the sham<br>
            love is performed but not felt<br>
            a son winces at his mother's touch<br>
            a daughter eats each meal alone<br>
            a mother wonders why her children are silent<br><br>
            this is a home where love is declared at occassions where it should be<br>
            and forgotten at most<br>
            where the words exist to abolve guilt and repair damage<br>
            but have no place otherwise.<br>
            this is a home where tears are cried in silence<br>
            and smiles are tight-lipped<br>
            where photos are forced and never hung on walla lest it feel too homely<br>
            where comfort is in things and not each other<br><br>
            this is a home where love does not live<br>
            despite convincing appearances.<br>
            and despite best efforts it is too late for it to grow <br>
            so instead,<br>
            son and daughter will have to seek it elsewhere<br>
            and mother will end up alone.<br>
