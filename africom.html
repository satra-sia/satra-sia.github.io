            <h1>AFRICOM</h1>
            <p>Since 2007, the United States has been sowing its colonial seeds across Africa
                through its security intiative, USAFRICOM. Perhaps you have heard of it, but
                what remains covert is how this has allowed the U.S. to exercise colonial 
                power and exploit African nations for what seems to be the millionth time in
                the continent's history. </p>

            <h2>What exactly is AFRICOM?</h2>

            <p>According to the organisation itself, USAFRICOM, an acronym for for U.S Africa
                Command, 'provides command and control of military forces in peace and war' 
                in order to secure the defence of African nations and, hold on, 'U.S national
                interests'. Critical to understanding how AFRICOM operates as a neocolonial 
                imposition on Africa is assessing what interests the U.S. exactly has in Africa
                and how this causes and encourages sanctioned wars, genocides, and the exploitation
                of Africa's resources. AFRICOM's headquarters are in Germany and has a team of
                over 2000 individuals between Germany and Africa including military personnel.</p>

            <p>Before we come onto how the U.S. is abusing its power, let's think about what AFRICOM
                claims it's doing in Africa. In 2010, an article by Robert Moeller was released 
                urging readers to believe that the 'U.S. military is not trying to take over Africa'
                instead it details the U.S.' hands off approach to security and defence. It explains
                how Africa is near incapable of curtailing its own security challenges as if all 54
                nations are experiencing homogenous concerns. Moeller stresses that the U.S is 
                keeping its footprint in Africa 'limited' and that AFRICOM works to its best ability
                when 'listens to the concerns of its African partners'. I have linked this article
                if you want to read the full extent of this blatant propaganda but what this 
                clearly constructs is an altruistic, peacekeeping image of the United States' 
                interests in Africa. This, I must stress is not the case. </p>
            
            <h2>So what are the U.S government's interests? What has AFRICOM actually been doing?</h2>
            <p>Western countries have sought after influence in Africa for centuries because of the
                wealth of resources that exist on the continent the establishment of AFRICOM participates
                in this realm of interest. In short, the U.S government was dissatisfied with its
                waning influence on the continent and started the initiative to protect and expand
                its sphere of influence and hence safeguard its access to African resources. </p>

            <p>AFRICOM's agenda, though, has been provoked by the fierce rivalry that exists between the
                United States and China. China's influence in Africa has been growing steadily since the
                mid 2000s through trade partnerships, Multinational Corporations (MNCs), and Foreign 
                Direct Investment (FDI). The potentiality of China having better access to resources in
                Africa threatened the existing hegemony of the U.S' image, hence AFRICOM exists to 
                preserve the international perception of the United States, also. Hence Africa is being
                used as a pawn in a new cold war between the U.S and China in which Africa bears the brunt
                of both superpowers' expansionist capitalism efforts. </p>

            <p>Through expressing concerns about terrorism and civilian safety and security (which in reality
                is the least of AFRICOM's concern) AFRICOM has conducted airstrikes and orchestrated military
                coups for the past decade in order to protect and control resources vital to U.S economic interest.</p>

            <h2>But where does this leave Africa?</h2>

            <p>In true colonial fashion AFRICOM and the 29 military bases across the continent is within
                its right to take action against any state that they deem to be uncooperative or damaging
                to the U.S image or its access to resources. Notably, Muammar Gaddafi was vehemently 
                against the formation and consolidation of AFRICOM when he was alive. It is not 
                coincidental that he was killed just 4 years after AFRICOM was established. Gaddafi was
                also an advocate for Africa having full self governance and independence from Western
                influence. Together, AFRICOM and NATO orchestrated the conflict that resulted in 
                Gaddafi's very public and televised death in 2011 to ensure the consolidation of US
                military bases across Africa without General Gaddafi's persistent opposition to the
                West's presence and influence on the continent. This further enabled the U.S to 
                collude with corrupt African leaders and forward the exploitation of African 
                resources and forward the United States' capitalist agenda for which these resources are vital.</p>

            <p>This was the first of many instances where AFRICOM used its influenced to diminish the burgeoning 
                power of an African government and sanction a conflict that left nations vulnerable.</p>

            <p>The following year, AFRICOM trained soldiers lead by Captain Amadou Sanogo overthrew Mali's 
                democratic government. Many reports lay blame on Gaddafi's use and armament of these soldiers 
                just years before but are deafeningly silent on AFRICOM'S or the United State's role in 
                dismantling Mali's ability to self govern in a democratic manner.</p>

            <p>Under the guise of counter terrorism, AFRICOM has persistently increased the presence of 
                U.S military in African nations. In West Africa, namely Nigeria and Niger, the U.S has devoted 
                billions of dollars to counter-terrorism and surveillance efforts yet civilians are still 
                suffering brutalities from terrorist organisations such Boko-Haram. In actuality AFRICOM is 
                maintaining the surveillance and control over the resources the U.S government requires to 
                benefit its own capitalist regime.</p>

            <p>The timeline below illustrates how relentless the United States has been in its resolve to gain 
                militant control over Africa's resources. What I will draw your attention to is the persistence 
                of AFRICOM conducted airstrikes across the continent that have ravaged towns and killed civilians 
                near continuously over the past decade. </p>

            <img src="AFRICOM GRAPHIC.jpg"/>

            <p>I hope it has become clear how USAFRICOM's presence in Africa is nothing short of neocolonialism. 
                AFRICOM exists purely to serve U.S interest and consolidate its power and influence. Most important 
                is its access to resources and pushing out other superpowers, namely, China. What this has resulted 
                in is a carefully constructed and thought out version of colonialism that reinforces the infantilisation 
                of African nations. In reality, many African nations have hardly had a chance to establish their own 
                sovereignty because of initiatives like AFRICOM cutting movements towards democratic governance at 
                the knees in favour of bolstering U.S wealth, power, and image. All of AFRICOM's military bases should 
                be removed from Africa and African nations should be allowed to freely self govern in the absence of 
                the tug of war between the U.S and China. One may question if this is too utopian or if another initiative 
                take the place of AFRICOM and extend the reach of colonialism? Whether utopian or not the retreat of U.S 
                militant force in Africa is a non-negotiable as the Black Alliance for Peace outlines. To ultimately 
                deconstruct colonialism and imperialism on the African continent, it must exist in the absence of the 
                aggressive efforts of Western capitalism, in order to ultimately come out of a position of subservience 
                to the United States. </p>
