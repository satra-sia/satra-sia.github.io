            <h1>The Magical Negro</h1>
            <h2>Manipulative Representation: A Cinderella Story</h2>
            <p>In August of this year, our favourite kpoet Adesayo Talabi or Simply Sayo tweeted 
                out her thoughts on representation in creative spaces and how it has the potential 
                to be used as a manipulative mechanism. In the thread Sayo encourages us to rely 
                less on representation for validation and instead to find comfort in personal 
                validation through reflection. Yet this point about representation being manipulative 
                remains poignant and in this article we are going to explore how this may be the 
                case through the Magical Negro character trope.</p>
            <p>If this is your first time hearing about the Magical Negro character or the Magical 
                Negro film, that is not by mistake. In film scholarship, this trope is hardly 
                touched upon and when it is, it is often downplayed or conflated with other racialised 
                tropes in mainstream cinema, this is also not by mistake. The Magical Negro, is a 
                Black individual in a film or tv show that possesses magical or superhuman powers 
                but exists solely to guide the White protagonist, who is typically downtrodden but 
                exhibits righteous values and behaviours. This trope emerged in the 90s and has been 
                a mechanism of positive representation of Black people, namely African Americans ever 
                since. Some examples of Magical Negroes are Morpheus from The Matrix Trilogy, Morgan 
                Freeman as God in Bruce Almighty, Denis Haysbert as God in Lucifer, Amenadiel also 
                from Lucifer, and most recently Billy Porter as The Fabulous Godmother in Kay Cannon's 
                Cinderella. At a glance, all these characters are positive characters that are free 
                from the stereotypes that have been present in mainstream cinema since the 1920s. 
                Yet upon closer inspection all of these characters, despite their superior abilities, 
                are in a position of servitude to the White lead, which is carefully disguised by 
                their wisdom and authority. So while the characters are presenting as strong and powerful 
                Black individuals, they exist to fulfil the White man's prophecy, very literally in the 
                case of The Matrix and Lucifer, and essentially uphold the values of White supremacy.</p>
            <p>Billy Porter in Cinderella is a particularly interesting case of the Magical Negro trope 
                for a number of reasons, the first being that the protagonist, Cinderella played by 
                Camilla Cabello, is also non-White. This brings a new dynamic to the fore as it compels 
                us to consider the how BIPOC-unity and colourism are represented and handled on screen. 
                The basic plot of the fairy-tale is that the fairy godmother, through her magic and 
                positive affirmations, helps Cinderella escape her life as servant, go to the Prince's 
                ball, and live with him happily-ever-after. In the context of Cannon's 2021 rendition the 
                fabulous godmother, presenting as a Black queer man, helps Cinderella, played by a 
                Latina woman, assimilate into the upper-echelons of White society through entrepreneurial, 
                capitalistic, and romantic means. Here the Magical Negro is upholding the values of the 
                American Dream and the assimilation of lighter skinned People of Colour into Whiteness. 
                Without any other characters with BIPOC heritage, Ella's success and happiness is ultimately 
                associated with her proximity to and position within this archetypal White family.</p>
            <p>Billy Porter's role is complicated further by his queer identity. In this instance, a 
                character that presents as queer manifests the straight union between Ella and the prince. 
                So while the queer community is being represented within this film and within a fairy-tale 
                narrative thats renditions have historically excluded them, the fruition of a heterosexual 
                union remains one of the main objectives of the protagonist. Fabulous Godmothers position 
                as Ella's helper and guide restricts their ability to represent queer values and expressions 
                of love. </p>
            <p>Both of these aspects of Cinderella are problematised further when you consider the impact of 
                both Billy Porter and Camilla Cabello's fanbases on the film's box office numbers. </p>
            <h2>But how is this 'manipulative'?</h2>
            <p>The Magical Negro, in this film and many others, is a manipulative construct as it aims to pacify 
                the Black community with forms of representation that appear positive on the surface but are no 
                more than glorified servants to the protagonist.This mechanism is used to display a harmonious 
                relationship between Black and White individuals who are working towards a common goal on a 
                righteous path. Yet it is often only the White counterpart that enjoys the spoils of this goal 
                and this path is often one that coincides with the values of Western European society. By putting 
                a Black individual in a position of power, such as God, directors invert the social reality, which 
                manipulates Black viewers into being satisfied with the representation they are receiving while 
                the character itself continues to reinforce the White institutions and values. The Magical Negro 
                is exactly the kind of representation that Adesayo warns us about as while it presents as positive, 
                it is in actuality manipulative and coercive. Its purpose is to appease and to satisfy rather 
                than to challenge and arrest. It is because of this that I urge you to watch more Black directed, 
                written, and produced media in order to expose yourself to representation that it not being used 
                as a tool for a White American agenda.</p>
