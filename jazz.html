            <h1>That's Jazz</h1>
            <h2>A Perspective on Racism and White Supremacy in the U.S.</h2>
            <p>
            Jazz, at its heart, is a genre of collaboration and the merging of cultures. From
            the vibrant performances in New Orleans Congo Square to Carnegie Hall, jazz has
            been steeped in the waters of cultural interactions, changes and discourse in
            the United States. An integral part of which is racial discourse. By way of its
            conception, development, and consumption, jazz has gone hand in hand with
            racial conflicts and triumphs over it and so upon closer inspection is an
            interesting lens through which we can look at racial discourse in the 
            United States.</p>
            <h2>Conception</h2>
            <p>
            1800s New Orleans, the birthplace of jazz. A city of constant movement and
            intersections of traders, slave owners, and travellers alike due to its position
            in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Mississippi River. This unique location
            resulted in an eclectic mix of people from across the world in the city at
            any one point. This included slaves from the African continent, the deep
            south and the Caribbean Islands. It is no secret that slaves made music 
            and danced to keep spirits high but this took on a unique form in New Orleans.
            Congo Square, now within Louis Armstrong Jazz Park, was the epicentre of
            song and dance for slaves from all three regions who were permitted by their 
            masters to come together and perform. These are the beginnings of jazz. 
            A genre born out of the enslavement and oppression of Black people across
            three continents all converging and communicating musically as a result of
            the shared pain they desperately needed relief from.</p>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
            At this point, the genre lacked the formal musical knowledge to be considered as
            anything more than slaves dancing for “massa”, which leads to jazz’s next 
            development. Also living in New Orleans during the 1800s was a racial group 
            called Creoles of Colour who were mixed-race individuals from slave owners, of
            slave ancestry. These individuals were often classically trained in various 
            musical instruments and despite having black ancestry and being of brown skin
            tones, did not identify as Black.</p>

            <h2>consumption</h2>
            <p>
            The consumption of jazz from the late 1800s to the present day can tell us a great
            deal about racism, White supremacy and White privilege in the United States. Jazz,
            with its fresh, hot, improvisational sound swept across the country. Popularised
            by touring pianist Jelly Roll Morton in the 1890s, jazz became increasingly 
            intertwined with minstrelsy as this was often the only way Black musicians were
            able to travel the country. As a Creole of Colour, Morton did not self-identify
            as Black despite the Jim Crow laws so he had little reservations rising to fame
            off the humiliation and mockery of Black people. This movement of jazz around 
            the country resulted in many different bands trying their hand at playing jazz,
            which included all-White bands.</p>
            <p>
            At this point, it is fair to conclude that jazz is a Black genre created by Black people
            and, whether they chose to recognise it or not, their descendants. However, the first jazz
            band to be recorded in the United States was the Original Dixieland Jazz Band in 1917 New
            York. An all-White band. This was no mistake, the producers knew that a new genre of music
            needed a palatable face. In the early 20th century U.S., this was a White face. The record
            did phenomenally well but in reality, was more jazz-like than jazz. The music was composed
            to drive the idea of improvisation without actually using the improvisational techniques
            of those who birthed the genre. This was an early form of the cultural appropriation 
            that we still see across the West in the modern-day. The U.S. in particular has a history
            of taking Black and non-White inventions and marketing them as White creations. In the
            case of jazz, this meant that anyone who couldn’t see live jazz performances in “Blacks
            only” spaces heard jazz for the first time from White musicians.</p>
            <p>
            Despite the Whitewashing of jazz’s national image, Black musicians, on account of their
            talent and innovation, still made it to the forefront of jazz culture and performance.
            These individuals would be your Louis Armstrongs, Count Basies, Sydney Bechets and Duke
            Ellingtons. Duke Ellington in particular was significant in overcoming the racial 
            barriers erected by both the law and the industry. His middle-class upbringing and formal
            musical education alongside New York’s lax segregation laws allowed him to navigate 
            White and Black spaces alike. In modern terms, Ellington was a master of code-switching,
            a mechanism many Black people used and still use to progress through White spaces despite
            White privilege. He famously played in the Cotton Club, which was an all-White venue that 
            fetishised the primitive Black man working in the cotton fields. The music Ellington played
            here was worlds apart from the dignified music he recorded and could play elsewhere. It 
            was known as Jungle Style.</p>
            <p>
            But it’s not Duke Ellington who is credited for breaking down these barriers, no. It is Benny
            Goodman, a White- Jewish man who felt he identified more with African American jazz players 
            than the White audiences as a result of his working-class upbringing and ethnically diverse 
            neighbourhood in Chicago. Goodman bought the arrangements of Black composer Fletcher Henderson
            and slowly integrated Black musicians into his ensembles. He became a symbol of the genre
            because of his ability to play the hot, free, improvisational sounds that made the genre so
            popular, but his White skin made the music marketable and although he credited his fellow
            musicians who were Black, there is still a sense of injustice to the African American 
            musicians who invented the genre.</p>
            <p>
            As a result of this Whitewashing of jazz music, today there has to be a concerted effort
            to relearn where jazz came from. The media, particularly the film industry, paints jazz
            as a sophisticated genre of the artsy, cultured, White upper-middle class rather than
            the product of Black pain and suffering at the hands of White people. Films such as 
            <em>Whiplash</em> continue to exclude its African American origins. However, the media
            has also more recently been promoting the Black face of jazz notably with the release
            of both <em>Soul</em> and <em>Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom</em> this year. But in reality,
            jazz remains a genre appropriated by the White middle class, torn from its origins and
            catapulted into the very White spaces it was once excluded from. Looking through the
            lens of jazz, we can see how racism and White supremacy shaped cultural movements in
            the U.S. and how U.S. history should not be addressed without considering the effects
            of systemic racism as it has moulded the nation every step of the way. Jazz is often
            regarded as truly American music and a national genre. I would say this is true only 
            in its ability to tell a sordid tale of a tumultuous history.</p>
