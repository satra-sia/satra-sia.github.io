            <h1>Dune</h1>
            <h2>Orientalism and The White Saviour</h2>
            <p>
                The recent film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel, <em>Dune</em>> has sparked
                a wave of discourse. From the lack of Zendaya’s highly anticipated presence
                in the film to its identity as a political science fiction film <em>Dune</em> (2021)
                left audiences marvelled and opinionated in equal measures. Though this reception
                shouldn’t take anyone who knows anything about Dune by surprise, Herbert’s entire
                saga is full of ideas about colonialism, imperialism, occupation, and liberation.
                Ever relevant, the books explore the effects of Orientalism and how reversing
                said effects is a vital element of anti-colonialism and post-colonialism. The
                2021 film however, in an attempt to adhere to contemporary political 
                correctness, pacified the “anti” in anti-colonialism and subsequently perpetuated
                the Orientalism that the source material was vehemently against.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Orientalism?</h2>
            <p>
                Orientalism, as theorised at length by Edward Said, is a byproduct of Colonialism 
                that reinforces the imposed divide between East and West or the periphery and the 
                metropolis. It can be understood as a way of thinking that became part of the 
                unconscious western bias against the global east and the global south. It distorts 
                the perception of non-western cultures and customs. It labels the east and south as 
                uncivilised, backwards, and savage and works to justify the need for Western 
                intervention, occupation, and rule in eastern and southern nations. Thus orientalism 
                is one of the pillars of modern imperialism as the acceptance of non-western existence 
                as exotic, abnormal, and uncivilised upholds the global hegemony that enables the theft 
                of resources and disenfranchisement of indigenous peoples across the global majority. 
                This works to the extent that victims of orientalism internalise the bias and struggle 
                to strive for liberation and self governance. This is what director, Denis Villeneuve, 
                attempts to illustrate with the Fremen in Dune. This portrayal is problematised throughout 
                the film by a number of things but especially by Paul Atreides and his development into a White saviour.              
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Dune</em> tackles the subject of orientalism cautiously. The Fremen are subjected to imperialism 
                as a result of the valuable resource that naturally exists on Arrakis, Spice. Spice harvesting 
                is vital for space travel in <em>Dune</em> lore and to uphold the emperor’s right to assign other houses 
                to rule Arrakis, such as Harkonnen and Atreides, the Fremen are universally understood to be 
                savage, irresponsible, and in critical need of ruling and ownership. Simultaneously, 
                Fremen technology is used to navigate the geography of Arrakis. Despite being depicted 
                as the kind ruler, Leto Atreides persistently asserts his desire to attain “desert power”. 
                I hope the parallels between real world imperialism and Dune’s premise are becoming clear.

                I described the film’s approach to orientalism as cautious as while the Muslim and Arab 
                influences are evident to the discerning eye, the book’s Muslim influences have been 
                significantly diluted as Villeneuve opted to omit rather than adapt Hubert’s less than 
                politically correct depiction of Muslims. As a result it pacifies the real world 
                anti-colonial connections. For example, by referring to the Fremen liberation as the 
                “Holy War” as opposed to Jihad as it is called in the book Villeneuve negates the 
                possibility that the film could dismantle the connections between Jihad, and contemporary 
                Islamic terrorism. Ultimately this works to sanitise the anti-colonial and anti-western 
                sentiment in the film and satisfy the unconscious bias against Muslim and Arab peoples 
                as people who are in need of Western guidance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Infrequent colloquial Arabic, brown skin, head coverings, and sparse Middle Eastern 
                and North African (MENA) accents are used to season the film rather than anchor it 
                in anti-colonialism. This, in conjunction with the lack of Arab cast and crew 
                members, continues to uphold orientalist views rather than challenge them. A Muslim 
                or Arabic aesthetic is used and exoticised without engaging with the significance 
                of anti-western beliefs in the Middle East. By diluting the “Muslimness” of Dune 
                and hence minimising the link between Spice harvesting and the West’s lust for and 
                dependency on Middle Eastern oil, Villeneuve discourages the audience from forming 
                a critical opinion of Western occupation in the Middle East.

                This is extended by the alignment of the audience with House Atreides rather than with the 
                Fremen. We understand that the film encourages the spectator to take a stance against the 
                active and brutal colonialism of the Harkonnen and the emperor but it fails to reinforce 
                that characters such as Leto Atreides and Duncan Idaho are also aggressors just as Western 
                liberals are aggressors in non-western spaces. As I mentioned earlier, Leto is depicted 
                as a kind ruler in contrast to the grotesque Baron Harkonnen. He vows not to impose on 
                Fremen communities and is committed to working alongside Fremen leader Stilgar and 
                subsequently is the lesser of two evils. However the film fails to portray him and House 
                Atreides as an evil. With POC actors smattered across his ranks and his death an act of 
                defiance against House Harkonnen, Leto Atreides provides a Western liberal audience with 
                a handsome means of identification and absolution from taking accountability for the 
                colonial aggression of neo-liberalism.
            </p>

                This is problematised further when Timothee Chalamet’s Paul Atreides is constructed as 
                the White Saviour of the Fremen population. In Paul’s visions we see him lead a Fremen 
                army in revolution and we understand that the Fremen become liberated yet remain under 
                the leadership of a White man. Paul is depicted becoming one with the Fremen. His 
                openness to learning and appreciating their customs and culture distinguishes him from 
                his house. At the conclusion of the film, he asserts to his mother that his path leads 
                into the desert and we, the audience, further understand that Paul’s destiny as the 
                “Mahdi” (as Chani calls him), “The one”, or most frequently the “Lisan al gahib” is 
                to liberate the Fremen and free Arrakis. However, the lack of criticism of Paul’s 
                position as a Messiah of sorts prevents the film’s potential to engage with anti-liberal
                and anti-orientalism discourse to a greater extent because it depicts the Fremen as 
                remaining dependent on external and White leadership rather than taking up the 
                responsibility of their own liberation and the audience is not encouraged to question 
                it. This again upholds an Orientalist mindset that infantilises the Fremen while 
                naturalising Paul as a leader. Chani is sceptical of Paul being the Mahdi but we learn
                this after we have seen her as his wife in Paul’s visions. Her suspicion is therefore 
                rendered a passing comment rather than an impetus for the audience to get behind and 
                question their acceptance of Paul as the Lisan al gahib. In addition, the use of Zendaya’s 
                star power to market Dune and her absence from the majority of the film regurgitates this 
                use of Fremen assets in the ascendence of an external agenda as we must remember that 
                Paul’s identity as the Lisan al gahib has been carefully calculated by the Bene Gesserit 
                who don a European Christian aesthetic. While we expect to see more from Chani in the 
                second part, I do wonder how many people saw <em>Dune</em> to see Zendaya.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately the film does not take a nuanced enough stance in regard to Orientalism and 
                contributing to post-colonial discourse. Instead it naturalises White liberals as leaders 
                and minimised MENA and Muslim influences to easily appease liberal audiences who likely 
                left the cinema chuffed with themselves at watching a film with such radical views. <em>Dune</em> 
                fails to address how Orientalism is internalised and results in the acceptance of White liberalism
                as the ideal. So while parts of Dune are clearly anti-colonial, it is neither post-colonial nor 
                anti-orientalist. The difference between them is made significant by understanding the how the 
                effects of colonialism extend far beyond active oppression, represented by the emperor and the 
                Harkennen, and are woven into the fabric of an occupied people like the Fremen. Due to its failure 
                to aptly criticise the presence of a white saviour and encourage the audience to root for the Fremen 
                to govern themselves and recognise Paul as an oppressor, <em>Dune</em> remains a watered-down, piecemeal 
                anti-colonial film that ultimately extends the Orientalism that its source material aimed to dismantle.
