            <h1>Manipulated by Marvel</h1>
            <h2>How film can be propaganda?</h2>
            <p>There has hardly been a Western political regime that has not been accompanied by an array of propaganda films since the entertainment medium was made popular in the early 20th century. From the Second World War to the Red Scare to the War on Terror, Western cinema and Hollywood cinema in particular has used its sphere of influence to amass public support for political regimes. The War on Terror, however, utilises cinema in a fashion distinct from its predecessors. The union of the tragedy of 9/11, the rate of production and consumption of Hollywood, and the infinitely broad demographic is a dangerous concoction that permits a near constant barrage of propaganda promoting the War on Terror to not only Western audiences but international audiences. </p>
            <h2>Before we get into how anti-terrorist propaganda has been communicated by giants such as Marvel and the Transformers franchise, what exactly do we mean by the War on Terror?</h2>
            <p>After the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, President Bush declared a zero-tolerance policy for terrorists and terrorist organisations. Over the next 15 years, this resulted in two wars in the Middle East the assassination of both Saddam Hussein and Osama Bin Laden, and of course an increase in Islamophobia across the West. The communication of Western Ideology through cinema has aided the U.S. government and military in waging war on both Afghanistan and Iraq while concealing the role the West played in the development of terrorist organisations such as Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and ISIS. The alignment of the saviour trope in superhero films with Western anti-terrorist ideology is a particularly potent tonic that works to absolve the U.S. from their involvement in facilitating the presence of modern terrorism and the provision of weapons and arms to terrorist organisations to destabilise governments in Africa and the Middle East as I discussed in my last article on AFRICOM. To illustrate how this works, we will be using the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a case study.</p>
            <p>The mechanism that works throughout Marvel films to promote ideology is idolisation. Not only are the main characters superheroes that have abilities beyond our human capacity, but they each engage in personal growth and development before aligning themselves with the righteous path. So while their physical prowess may be infinitely out of reach, their flaws and imperfections makes them the perfect vessel for idolisation as it communicates that their morals and resolve are every bit as human as the spectator.</p>
            <p>This rhetoric is not uncommon in the genre yet what remains significant with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is the pairing of this trope with the opposition consistently being a representative of modern terrorist organisations. Perhaps the most obvious is how the Iron Man trilogy uses Obadiah Stane as a way to not only condemn terrorism and its sympathisers, but also to control the narrative surrounding the  U.S government's involvement in the development of terrorist organisations. The films depict Stane as an individual who acted of his own accord independently to the government and the military to sell arms to organisations in the middle east. While Tony Stark, an arms manufacturer, goes on this pilgrimage-like journey that solidifies him in position boldly opposing the use of arms in the middle East.</p>
            <p>The truth remains that the U.S military has directly facilitated the acquisition of arms in that region. Yet the films align the government, the military, Stark, and ultimately the audience with this path of righteousness that deems the terrorists illogical and barbaric while simultaneously condemning individuals that defect. </p>
            <p>What makes this particularly sinister is how wide Marvel's reach is. I'm sure you all remember seeing children walking around in Iron Man helmets or carrying Captain America shields. Children and adults alike regardless of gender flock to the cinemas (or Disney + post-pandemic) to watch these films that are each grossing billions of dollars in the box office. Each cinema-goer for each film, therefore is being plied with anti-terror sentiment, which is more often than not associated with a foreign face, typically Middle Eastern, and a diverging set of values stemmed in non-Christian beliefs.</p>
            <p>Take Thanos, the ultimate foe of the entire Avengers squadron. His vision for a harmonious universe is one where half of the population is indiscriminately executed, which he achieves at the end of Infinity War. Yet what this is grounded in is religious terminology and semantics. The words 'salvation' and 'sacrifice' are continuously used, with Thanos even sacrificing his favourite child, Gamora, in order to achieve this balance, this harmony that he foresees for the universe. This not only communicates how the West strives to depict the barbarism of terrorism but how dangerous a difference in ideology can be to the stability of the Western metropolis. Historically, the West has sought to eradicate any ideology that challenges the sanctity of Western capitalism and Christianity, which is what we see exhibited with Thanos in Infinity War and Age of Ultron. Thanos is essentially imposing an ideology that combats the overconsumption and overproduction that has been caused by capitalism, the near biblical cleansing that he enacts is an act that ultimately results in the Avengers undergoing a great sacrifice with the death of their most prominent members. When you consider how these characters in particular are idolised, the films communicate that global terrorism must be eradicated irrespective of the personal cost that we may endure as a result. This level of loyalty and dedication that the films inspire becomes dangerous when you take into account the criminal acts that the west and particularly the U.S government has enacted in Africa and the Middle East in the name of counter-terrorism. The emphasis on the religious standpoint further extends Western Islamophobia and is extended by the fact that Thanos is both non-White and non-human. The dehumanisation of the opposition works in tandem with the humanisation of the superheroes, which I discussed earlier, to aid the alignment of the spectator with the "righteous superheroes", who are representatives of the U.S government, and the condemnation of Thanos and the nameless, faceless terrorists that he represents.</p>
            <p>You might be thinking to yourself that Marvel is just one studio and that not everyone watches Marvel films to which I would say that it has the most significant demographic eating out the palm of its hand. Young men and boys who are most likely to actually to join the armed forces to combat terrorism themselves are met with countless images of positive representation constantly communicating that they should choose to do the right thing, which in this case is support the West's counter-terrorism efforts. Furthermore, the films that have been released alongside the Marvel Cinematic Universe that target the same demographic communicate the same message. The Transformers franchise is a key example of this. They appeal to the ordinary, unremarkable, suburban, White young man. They tell him to fight the terrorists (the decepticons), do his country proud, and get the girl. The level of self-insertion that those films encourage made them a formidable piece of propaganda.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, what is most underhand about these Hollywood films is that they are not deemed propaganda films yet they are conveying significant amounts of ideology to incredibly wide audiences. The general American audience is hardly receptive to outwardly geopolitical film but Hollywood wraps ideology in this fantastical package that is reimagined into a new film almost every year. Through this the U.S government disguises their involvement in the development of terrorism, increases the anti-terrorist sentiment in the nation, and is allowed to turn a blind eye to the rampant domestic terrorism. To conclude, this isn't a boycott Marvel article, I think we can all agree that they are some of the best films the superhero, action genre has to offer. Instead, I urge you to watch films consciously in order to decode the implicit propaganda that is woven into the amazing scenes we are presented with. </p>
