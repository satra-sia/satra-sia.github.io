            <h2> How systemic racism demonises rap music</h2>

            <p>
                In 2020s last moments, Maryland States highest court ruled in favour 
                of rap lyrics being admissible in court as evidence against a defendant
                as a result of Lawrence Montague’s alleged involvement in the murder of
                George Forrester in 2017.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the first time, the prejudice that has existed
                in the United States and the United Kingdom
                against rap music and its creators has been
                validated by a judicial system. Their argument?
                Rap lyrics not only reveal an individual’s
                wrongdoings but encourage those who listen to
                their music to partake in violent acts and gang
                activity. But underlying this defence is a sordid
                history of hatred of rap music fuelled by racial
                biases against Black communities in Western
                countries. The notion that rap music instigates
                gang violence reinforces the centuries-old narrative that 
                Black people, and therefore their art, are inherently violent 
                and allows local and national governments to absolve themselves 
                of the responsibility of tackling the socioeconomic issues that
                are actually causing gang violence within Black communities.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m sure many of you are thinking “but rap lyrics are violent” and you wouldn’t be
                wrong. Rap lyrics from 2Pac to Nicki Minaj feature violent imagery and in some cases
                detailed descriptions of criminal or gang activity. But I must ask, how much of the
                media that we consume features violent imagery? How many Quentin Tarantino films 
                involve extreme violence? How many Shakespeare plays? How many deaths are in George
                R.R Martin’s Game of Thrones? All of these heralded creators are lovers of violent
                acts yet they do not experience the same level of scrutiny that rappers do. Why?
                Because they, like many others, are protected by their Whiteness.

            </p>

            <p>
                What I mean by this is that these artists are allowed to explore violent themes without
                their character or influence being called into question. This is because, despite history
                books filled with events linking White people and violence, the racial hegemony in Western
                societies does not encourage us to view White people as the aggressor. Black people, however,
                have been depicted as violent and primitive throughout Western history, which has formed the 
                racial biases that still exist
                today. While this is expressed in different forms, the principal remains the same — Black
                 people are violent and 
                barbaric and hence must be controlled. In this case, this extends to the music that Black people create.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many of the conversations sparked from Maryland’s ruling sought to draw comparisons between other genres
                 of music that, despite violent imagery, are not tied to violence within their respective communities.
                Heavy metal was a genre that stood out to me the most and I thought it necessary to really paint this
                picture. Metal music features incredibly violent lyrics, the worst of which are far too graphic and
                sickening to include in this article.
            </p>

            <p>

                They detail brutal murders, rape, necrophilia,
                violence against women, infanticide,
                matricide, and many more horrific things I’m
                sure you don’t want to picture. Having listened
                to both metal and rap extensively, I can assure
                you that Gucci Mane’s Murder for Fun has
                nothing on Autopsy’s Charred Remains
                (seriously, don’t listen to it, it’s nauseating). Yet
                metal lyrics aren’t brought into murder trials as
                evidence against White defendants nor are
                they blamed for school shootings or serial
                killings. The key difference between rap and metal is that 
                metal’s image is overwhelming White. These artists and their 
                audiences are protected by Whiteness, and Black musicians and 
                audiences are not recipients of this same privilege.
            </p>

            <p>
                Demonising rap music is one link in a long chain of victim-blaming when
                it comes to the treatment of marginalised communities within Western 
                societies, namely the U.S and the U.K. In these two countries, rap music
                has been consistently blamed for the existence and development of gang 
                violence in non-White communities.
                However, when you look at the textbook causes of crime and illicit activity, 
                including gang-related violence, music of any genre is not among them. Instead
                there is: lack of opportunity, little social mobility, deprivation, poverty, 
                low- quality education, low-quality housing, limited access to credit, and many
                more socioeconomic issues that disproportionately affect communities of colour
                and particularly Black communities because of systemic racism.
                The segregation and ghettoisation of African American people alone has caused a
                number of the issues listed above. So while violent rap lyrics may be symptomatic
                and run parallel to gang violence in some cases, the root of the problem has
                existed long before hip hop, drill, or grime.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the U.K, drill music videos are persistently removed from YouTube and are publicly
                blamed for the acceleration in knife crime rates. This creates a situation where 
                individual artists, groups and songs are being held accountable for alarming homicide
                figures without any concrete data displaying a causal relationship between drill and knife crime.
                This implies that the issue is internal in these communities, that young Black men in major 
                cities such as London and Birmingham are creating the problem of knife crime independent of the
                socioeconomic issues they face as a result of their race. This mechanism of blaming the victim
                or their own predicament allows governments to avoid addressing the underlying issues that are
                known causes of crime which only perpetuates the issue further.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ultimately, it’s time that local and national governments realised that scapegoating rap 
                music is counterproductive in reducing gang-related violence in Black communities. But the
                ruling in Maryland and the stance of U.K officials suggests that this epiphany is a long
                way off. It seems much more convenient to have these communities internalise the problems
                that systemic racism has dealt them rather than pull out their wallets and uplift these
                communities that make the music we all love to listen to.
