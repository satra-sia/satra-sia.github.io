            <h1>Kawaii Colonisers</h1>
            <h2>The Rebranding of Japan's Bloody Past</h2>

            <p>
                I want you to close your eyes and picture Japan. What is it that you see? I’m sure
                the visualisation of a foreign land is different for everyone but I’m certain that
                many of you pictured cute mascots, characters from your favourite anime, or perhaps
                Lolitas. What you probably didn’t picture is Manchurian skulls piled high in the
                streets — just one product of Japan’s brutal imperial past. This dichotomy between
                Japan’s history and Japan’s present image is not an accident. Kawaii culture has
                been part of a concerted effort to transform the international perception of
                Japan and Japanese culture. Genius right? I would argue that sinister is more
                fitting. The lack of accountability for colonisation and imperialism problematises
                how we perceive the severity of the consequences and implications of such actions.
            </p>
            <h2>But First, what exactly is kawaii culture?</h2>
            <p>
                If you’ve ever tried to learn any Japanese, you probably know that kawaii is the
                Japanese word for cute. While it is used in passing as a compliment or a casual
                description, kawaii culture is something bigger and far more infectious. Kawaii
                culture was introduced to the world in the 1960s during a period of immense
                economic development for Japan. It is widely associated with not just cuteness
                but softness, vulnerability, and shyness. This permeated into many aspects
                of entertainment, think Hello Kitty, Animal Crossing, and Rilakkuma.</p>
            <p>
                Kawaii culture is also associated with fashion and style. The Lolita aesthetic,
                which is widely popular in Japan, embraces all things kawaii. The soft pastels 
                and traditional European silhouettes connote daintiness, helplessness, and the 
                epitome of femininity.</p>
            <p>
                But kawaii culture has spread beyond entertainment and fashion. Walking around 
                Japan you begin to notice that cute characters exist on everything including 
                trains, national landmarks such as Tokyo Tower and even government buildings. 
                It’s widely known that prefectures in Japan have their own mascots, one of the 
                most famous being Kumamon, Kumamoto’s mascot, but even Tokyo’s wards have their 
                own mascots. The ward I stayed in was Nerima and we had an adorable mascot named 
                Nerimaru. His face was on everything from building sites to earthquake safety 
                manuals. Putting cute faces on everything was a conscious effort from the Japanese 
                government to inspire compassion and respect not just towards each other but towards 
                their surroundings.</p>
            <h2>How is this linked to imperialism?</h2>
            <p>
                At the end of the Second World War in 1945, Japan had spent almost a century colonising 
                the majority of East and Southeast Asia including Taiwan, Korea, parts of Mainland China, 
                Manchuria, Vietnam and the Philippines. The Japanese imperial flag still causes forms of 
                PTSD for those who lived under the rule of the Dai Nippon Teikoku, or the Empire of Japan. 
                Japan committed many atrocities in these nations that have caused irreversible damage, 
                mainly in terms of the state of Southeast Asian economies and political systems.</p>
            <p>
                So, when Japan is defeated by the U.S. in 1945, albeit with excessive force, its 
                international image is not a pretty picture. Alongside Japan’s ruthlessness as the 
                metropolis of an empire, its position as an ally to the big bad wolf of war crimes, 
                Nazi Germany, resulted in Japan being perceived as a heartless nation that endorses 
                xenophobic, racist, and violent values. Post-war Japan, like many other countries, 
                was also in great economic decline under the occupation of another country. It was 
                in desperate need of the spoils of export-led growth and international trade. Japan’s 
                development in this respect was deemed a miracle and was the kind of growth that 
                had never been seen before.
            </p>
            <p>
                But underpinning all that success was a re-design of Japan’s international image. Through 
                the use of kawaii culture, Japan was slowly starting to be perceived as the land of all 
                things soft, cute, and cuddly, which was a complete reversal of their image from 1868 to 
                1945. Whether completely realised or not, this worked wonders in suppressing Japan’s 
                imperialist past. As a subordinate to America, post-war Japan was infantilised and kawaii 
                culture was both a by-product and catalyst of this. It was a means of expression for 
                many artists affected by the economic hardship, but the focus on being cute and youthful 
                portrayed Japanese people as juvenile. Takashi Murakami, an incredibly well known Japanese 
                artist, questions why Japanese culture is so ”enamoured” with being cute and child-like. 
                Taking into account Japan’s desire to forget their history as an oppressor, it seems as 
                though Japanese culture is enamoured with portraying itself as harmless.
            </p>
            <h2>Is this even problematic, though?</h2>
            <p>
                Short answer, yes. It’s problematic because it invalidates the experiences of those who 
                were victims of the Japanese Empire. Many communities are still suffering as a result 
                of Japanese occupation in their countries during the Second World War in particular. 
                While there’s no way of undoing what has been done, oppressors must be held accountable 
                for their actions rather than evading the negative consequences that come with the 
                fall of an empire, including being perceived as merciless and barbaric.</p>
            <p>
                The road to reparations is a long and arduous one. However, taking responsibility for 
                wrongdoings is a good start. Although it seems harmless in comparison to a concert 
                hall full of people singing ‘Rule Britannia’ every year — Britain, we’re looking at 
                you —, it undermines the severity of the actions of imperialism. At the expense of the 
                quality of life in many East Asian countries, Japan was in a position to strengthen 
                itself internationally and eventually become one of the richest countries in the world. 
                It’s no secret that we all love kawaii culture but the victims of Japanese imperialism 
                deserve better than the face of their suffering being reduced to anthropomorphic animals 
                and girls in pastel dresses.</p>
