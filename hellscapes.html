        <p>
            You know i could never lie to you<br>

        Your ink black pools were truth serums to me<br>

        So when i said i would miss you, you know that was in candour<br>

        But you’re everywhere<br>

        In my mind, my bed, my beaten path<br>

        My favourite bridge and little laughs<br>

        I catch myself reminiscing<br>

        but really you’re sitting in my shadow<br>

        Your presence your memories fill my lungs like smog<br>

        I’m struggling to breathe these days<br>

        My blackened lungs burn as i inhale<br>

        You surround me<br>

        In the quiet, in the loud<br>

        I flinch <br>

        I obsess <br>

        I hear your 4 rings for me<br>

        You see<br>

        I told you i would miss you in candour<br>

        But the truth changes like the wind<br>

        The air is so thick with you i haven’t had a moment to miss you<br>

        To smile about what we had<br>

        To cry about what we had<br>

        The smog leaks from my mouth like poison, i curse you instead<br>

        The memories of you marred by my venomous words<br>

        your inky pools black holes swallowing the love i had<br>

        Quicker than id like<br>

        It hurts to fall out of love with you, too<br>

        I’m being as honest as i can<br>

        I never wanted to hate you<br>

        I wanted to wish you well<br>

        I wanted to keep a place for you in my heart<br>

        I wanted to love you forever<br>

        But the ash that lines my throat<br>

        The fire in the pit of my stomach<br>

        The hellscapes you draw on my skin<br>

        All i see is red<br>

        My glasses are blood tinted, no, stained<br>

        My roses have wilted and died, and only the thorns remain<br>
