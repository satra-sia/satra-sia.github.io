            <h1>Natural Hair, Who Cares?</h1>
            <h2>Has the Natural Hair Movment been Recolonised?</h2>


            <p>The natural hair movement is a highly discussed topic within Black communities 
                across the globe. It was pioneered by African American Civil Rights Activists 
                during the 60s and 70s for the purpose of empowering Black people and affirming 
                to themselves that “Black is Beautiful” in the face of those who would rather see 
                the erasure of Blackness. One way that this desire for erasure has been expressed 
                and spread is through putting down natural hair textures and encouraging and in some 
                cases forcing Black people and Black women in particular to straighten their hair 
                whether through chemicals or through heat. Wearing natural hair, particularly in an 
                afro is often perceived by Whiteness as an act of defiance and rebellion, which has 
                led to it being deemed unprofessional and unfit for the workplace and for school. 
                et what natural hair supporters have continued to tell us is that wearing your hair 
                in its most natural form is an act of self love and self acceptance irrespective of
                 whether White spaces are accepting. The natural hair movement saw a diminution of support 
                 during the 80s and 90s but saw a revival again in the late 2000s and 2010s due to the rise 
                 of influencer culture and social media. Black women began teaching themselves how to care 
                 for their hair through platforms such as YouTube and later Instagram, which imbued Black 
                 women with the confidence to maintain and wear natural styles. Now this all sounds 
                 peachy but, as with most movements, it has its intrinsic problems. What I will be 
                 focusing on however is how this problems have festered into the recolonisation of 
                 natural hair and how Black women are turning away from twists outs and back to the “creamy crack”. </p>
            <p>The natural hair movement has been problematised by the privileging of looser curl 
                textures and lighter-skinned women. Which has led to the exclusion and silencing 
                of the women who truly needed the movement in the first place. In reality it’s 
                the darker skinned women with tighter curl patterns who are told to 
                ‘do something with their hair’ at an early age and told their hair is unprofessional 
                or ridiculed at school. Yet the face of the natural hair movement is not representative
                of these women. I’d like to point out that the women most widely credited for the 
                inception of the natural hair movement have always been lighter skinned, think 
                Angela Davis and Elaine Brown. However in the last decade the communities obsession
                with the curl patten chart has created a hierarchical system that has encouraged 
                natural women to focus on how loose their hair can appear. This has been reflected
                in which tutorials get pushed forward by an algorithm that already favours those 
                who are most able to assimilate into white beauty standards. Ultimately this had 
                caused an influx of styles and wash days that take hours if not days to perfect 
                and, you guessed it, the tighter your curls the harder you’ll have to work to 
                assimilate into this new beauty standard for what natural hair should look like.
                You should pre-poo, detangle with shampoo for maximum definition, avoid sulfates
                and parabens (whatever those are), use half a bottle of conditioner to define your
                curls further, rinse carefully, apply leave in conditioner, curl activator, gel, 
                now twist; braid; or bantu, sit under a hooded dryer and pray it comes out right. 
                If it sounds exhausting it’s because it is. It definitely doesn’t sound like the
                self love and self acceptance that Angela Davis was advocating for 50 years ago.
                Though having straight hair is not enforced on Black women as it was prior to 
                the movement, having loose, bouncy 3a-3c curls is the new normal and anyone 
                existing on the periphery of that made to feel less attractive and desirable as
                a Black woman just as Black women are made to feel in comparison to White women.
                So while curly hair widely more accepted, the influence of colourism and texturism
                on the natural hair community has given fuel to the recolonisation of natural hair.
                As a result of these ridiculously long routines focused on appeasing beauty 
                standards rather than embracing the beauty and individuality of *all* natural 
                textures Black women are pivoting back to relaxers and expressing that there 
                is no shame in having relaxed hair for the sake of ease and a shorter maintenance
                routine. Though I do agree that there is no shame in it and that hair has no 
                impact on ones self worth, it seems the natural hair movement has caused the
                 reverse of what it intended to achieve.</p>
            
            <p>Though recolonisation, in this case is two pronged fork. As usual Black women can’t
                have shit without white women piping up about something or other. In recent years,
                the curly girl method has been popularised through social media, it differs from
                the natural hair movement in that it focuses on helping white and non black POC
                women who have been brushing through their curls and straightening their curls
                their whole lives to learn how to take care of their curly hair. Using the 
                insidious hair chart as a point of reference, this is usually applicable to people
                who have type 2 hair. It seems harmless but what isn’t harmless is these women
                co-opting the natural hair movement and calling their curls and waves “natural hair”
                and approaching Black women saying “we’re both wearing our natural hair”.
                This behaviour from White women has led to Black women advocating for a distinction
                between wavy and curly hair and essentially gate-keeping who can claim they
                have curly hair or natural hair. But when is gatekeeping okay? Of course, 
                Black women don’t have ownership of curly hair but what they do have ownership
                of is the natural hair movement as this was started *by* Black women *for*
                Black women in the face of discrimination, oppression in many forms. I would 
                like to draw attention to the fact that many Black women still face hair
                discrimination and California is the only state in the US that has ruled against
                hair discrimination in schools and the work place. As a byproduct of this 
                discrimination White women were ridiculed at school for having curly hair called
                Shirley Temple etc. (just like Queen Liz) However, the need for the natural
                hair movement being exclusive to Black women stems from hair discrimination 
                towards Black communities being a weapon of systemic racism not individual
                accounts of playground taunts. Yet while Black women are still working to
                decolonise natural hair, White women inserting themselves in the movement
                hinders their ability to make significant strides as society will always
                look to centre Whiteness and relegate Blackness to the periphery. Hence 
                White women with curly hair are in a privileged position that enables them
                to talk over Black women and push them out of their own movement. After
                reading this article I want you to type ‘Cute Hairstyles for Curly Hair’ 
                into YouTube and make a mental note of how long it took to see a darker 
                skinned Black woman. There is a difference between being an ally and co-opting a 
                movement.  While it’s great that White women are embracing their curls, too, their 
                presence within the natural hair movement and their sense of entitlement in regard
                to being included is refocusing the movement and darker-skinned Black women with
                tighter curl patterns are *again* in the background, blurred out, on the periphery.</p>
            <p>So to answer the question ‘has the natural hair movement been recolonised’ I’d say that
                the natural hair community is putting up a good fight against recolonisation but with 
                the algorithmic forces at play alongside the ‘we’re all Black’ and ‘we all have curls’ 
                arguments from the groups that the movement privileges, the movement will soon be facing
                another dissolution. As 90s and 2000s trends come back into fashion I’m sure the straight
                hairstyles to match won’t be far behind. Without type 4 hair being at the centre of the 
                movement the resolve will continue to be diluted and subverted because those who were 
                supposed to be empowered are being silenced, excluded, overlooked, and ignored. In order 
                to survive, the movement and hence the media needs to be reframed and refocused.</p>
