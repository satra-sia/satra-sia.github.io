            <p>listen, i don't owe you anything<br>
            not a Davis fro or curls cascading<br>
            not popping or waving<br>
            I don't owe you an ounce of it.<br>
            I don't owe you soft I don't owe you length<br>
            I don't owe you weakness like i don't owe you strength<br>
            I definitely don't owe you hips that don't dip<br>
            small feet that don't trip<br>
            not an inch from my waist or on my hair<br>
            I don't owe you light, i don't owe you fair<br>
            not pillow lips to kiss your pains away<br>
            not today!<br>
            I don't owe you defined, you're gonna take this nose 
            bridge the way it was designed to guide me over troubled waters<br>
            does that ease your mind?<br>
            I don't owe you chocolate, caramel, or brown sugar<br>
            because i don't owe you sweet<br>
            you the next batter up?<br>
            don't strike out<br>
            i don't owe you another pitch<br>
            i don't owe you that girl, I don't owe you that bitch.<br>
            Like how i don't owe you nice or cute or quiet<br>
            I don't owe you a thing<br>
            not the loudest voice in the riot<br>
            not a whisper or a shout<br>
            I don't owe you my silence<br>
            I don't owe you my words neither<br>
            are you starting to get it?<br>
            I don't owe you a fucking thing!<br>
            Not the thickest thighs<br>
            coloured eyes<br>
            a held tongue
            or one of lies<br>
            I don't owe you sitting pretty<br>
            I don't owe you moody, alternative, gritty<br>
            not my time<br>
            not a dime, franc or shilling<br>
            I don't owe you obedient, I don't even owe you willing<br>
            I don't owe you your fetish, your fantasy<br>
            I don't owe you Bonet, Badu or Hill<br>
            I owe myself me<br>
            and I don't owe you <br>
            a fucking thing</p>
