        <h1>swallow</h1>
        <p>
            when i say i'm having a hard time no one comes running <br>

            because i'm stable and i'll figure it out <br>

            i get my work done, exercise and laugh<br>

            i don't lash out<br>

            i don't stop turning up and tuning in <br>

            i can function<br>

            and not just function but thrive <br>

            i've learned to bandage my own wounds<br>

            suture when needed <br>

            remedy my own sickness <br>

            splint my own broken bones <br>

            but there's a poison in me i don't have the antidote to<br>

            i hold her in my mouth like a second tongue <br>

            swollen and serpent <br>

            some days i can swallow her and she lives in the pits of my stomach<br>

            bubbling with the acid <br>

            my chest burns but i keep breathing <br>

            it feels like i don't have a choice <br>

            i don't have an oxygen tank <br>

            no scuba gear <br>

            somehow i can use my lungs to breathe underwater<br>

            but for how long<br>

            how long until i'm taken into the drink <br>

            before my lungs are filled with saltwater<br>

            before my alveoli swell and burst <br>

            before the poison pours out from my mouth and eyes and consumes me <br>

            before i can't get my work done, exercise, and laugh?<br>

            we won't know <br>

            for now my tongue will stay forked between prison bars <br>

            behind a close lipped smile <br>

            behind the facade <br>

            i'll keep swallowing her <br>

            holding her down down down<br>
            </p>
