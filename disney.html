            <h1>Disney's Diversity Dilemma</h1>
            <p>Disney, a cornerstone of generations of childhood nostalgia. A wonderland of magic, 
                fantasy, racism? Yes the Disney we know and love has a deep routed race problem 
                that has reared its ugly head in recent years by way of a new era of exposing the 
                injustices and unconscious biases that have been ignored for far too long. Historically, 
                Disney is oppressively White. From its conception until 1992, Disney exclusively featured 
                White stories about White people for and by White people. This kind of self indulgence 
                has led to the devastating lack of representation for children of colour who have missed 
                out on seeing themselves portrayed as princesses, princes, warriors and the like. Taking 
                into account the social context in which Disney was established, it is no surprise that 
                the exclusion of BIPOC characters is rife. America in the 1920s was decidedly an environment 
                that did not seek to celebrate the stories and lives of BIPOC Disney was not immune from 
                this sickness. However, a hundred years later in 2020, diversity in Disney films is a 
                problem that still persists and despite many mechanisms that have been listed to remedy 
                this, the notion that it isn’t enough still exists.</p>
            <h2>But why is this so problematic? Why do BIPOC children need to see themselves reflected in Disney films? </h2>
            <p>Simply put, equality. Equality in laughter, joy, and happiness. BIPOC children deserve to see 
                themselves as royalty, as heroes, and villains alike. BIPOC children deserve to experience 
                the same kind of magic that White children do when they imagine themselves as Elsa, 
                Rapunzel, or Cinderella. By locking the door to this kind of identification, BIPOC children 
                are told from an early age that they aren’t worthy and that they don’t have a place in the 
                same spaces that White children have. This perpetuates the narrative that BIPOC people are 
                undeserving and the effects this can have on children are critical. </p>
            <h2>So what happened in 1992? </h2>
            <p>Well the first non-White Disney princess graced the silver screen. The film Aladdin paved the
                way for Disney films with BIPOC characters with its rich cultural influences from the Middle
                East. Trampolining off the Arabian Nights, Aladdin leapt great heights in terms of inclusivity
                and diversity in animated film and Disney films in particular. For the first time a BIPOC 
                story was celebrated. Following this, Disney released Pocahontas in ’95, Hercules in ’97, 
                and Mulan in ’98. These films were extremely successful in the box office and proved that 
                BIPOC stories were just as lucrative as White stories. However, while these films were important
                to the BIPOC community, they are riddled with cultural inaccuracies such as the exoticism 
                and racist depiction of Arab culture in Aladdin and the watering down of Pocahontas’ real story.
                Furthermore, the majority of the main roles in these films are played by White actors and the 
                stories have been interpreted by White writers. The reveals a further issue with this generation
                of Disney films; White people capitalising off BIPOC stories without involving BIPOC people 
                in the creative process. </p>
            <p>Fast-forward ten years to 2009 when Princess Tiana and Prince Naveen are brought to life to 
                represent the Black and Brown communities. Here Disney has solved some of the problems that
                the earlier films encountered such as hiring Black actresses and actors to play Black 
                characters. However, it trips and falls again through demonising New Orleans voodoo and 
                portraying Tiana and Naveen as animals (frogs) for the majority of the film. Using Voodoo
                or dark arts as the source of villainy in Black films is not new. This is a gripe that 
                the Blaxploitation films of the 1970s also suffered from. New Orleans voodoo has strong 
                ties to the African voodoo that ex-slaves practiced in the melting pot city. These practices
                were a way that ex-slaves stayed in connection to their ancestral roots, demonising this 
                connection is a critical blunder. Tiana and Naveen being frogs for the majority of the 
                film and their love story is another. It minimises the positive impact of having Black and
                Brown characters in the film. </p>
            <p>It’s 2016, Disney is operating in a post-Frozen world when Moana is released. This film was an
                incredible example of representation for Pacific Islanders and Polynesian people. All the 
                characters were played by people from those regions such as Dwayne Johnson and Nicole Scherzinger.
                The score was written by the insanely talented and well read composers Lin-Manuel Miranda, 
                Mark Mancina, and Opetaia Foa’i who utilised traditional Pacific Island music, composition styles
                and musicians to create a magical and culturally sensitive score. By this point, Disney has nailed
                the BIPOC animated film. So why in 2020 is there still a diversity issue?</p>
            <p>Firstly, the introduction of a new BIPOC character is seemingly happening every 10 years or so as it
                stands, which means that each generation has one instance of representation, or two, if you’re lucky.
                Secondly, Disney has turned towards remaking the successful films of the 90s to solve this issue.</p>
            <h2>Are these remakes really the solution?</h2>
            <p>While the intentions behind them are promising, the films rely on the monetisation of nostalgia to solve
                an issue that can only really be solved by innovation and creating new characters. The Aladdin remake
                still suffers from combining Indian and Middle Eastern cultures haphazardly and fails to subvert or
                address the exoticism in the original film or the source material, Arabian Nights while Mulan had a
                critical lack of Chinese creators on the crew and in the writers room.  In addition to this the 
                filming location was disappointingly tone deaf as a number of the scenes were filmed in locations within
                the Xinjiang Province where the Chinese government is keeping Uyghurs Muslims in concentration camps. 
                These oversights negate the positive impact that these films could have made. In the case of the greatly
                anticipated The Little Mermaid remake Disney has utilised White outrage as a marketing ploy by placing 
                Black faces and voices, namely Halle Bailey and Daveed Diggs, into White narratives instead of creating 
                new narratives for the Black community. These factors are significant bumps in the road for Disney’s 
                journey to solving their diversity dilemma. Which makes me question, are they actually seeking to achieve
                equality in their filmography or are they seeking to give the BIPOC community a piecemeal offering to 
                appease low level grievances? Whatever the case may be, we will be watching. </p>
